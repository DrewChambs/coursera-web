      <p>Gi doesn’t think of or store its data this way.
        Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series
        of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git,
        every time you commit, or save the state of your
        project, Git basically takes a picture of what all
        your files look like at that moment and stores a
        reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if
        files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file
        again, just a link to the previous identical file
        it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more
        like a stream of snapshots.
